       "  \"1. Good information. . 97% use the Internet to become better informed and, according to Forrester Research, high quality content is the most popular reason for returning to a site. Including informative pages on a website adds value, making it more than simply an online brochure or shop window. If you are retailing products, include information on after care or answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) on a dedicated page. A site that provides useful information sticks in a user's mind and will be. revisited in the future.. . 2. Up to date information. . However good your information, if it never changes people will only return when they want something they already know is there. Offering the latest topics, trends, breakthroughs and theories, plus relevant news headlines all help to position a. site as the 'go to' place for news and insights, prompting users to drop in regularly to find out what's new.. . 3. Community. . Create a sense of community by catering to your customers' needs and tailor content and services to their specific requirements. For example, an online fishing tackle retailer might broaden its appeal by including weather reports and river pollution updates, links to travel sites and a photo gallery for members to display their biggest catches. An angler who stumbles upon the site looking to purchase a new rod will quickly view it as a meeting place for like-minded people and return regularly.. . 4. Interaction. . Allowing users to contribute makes the online experience more enjoyable, which is why interactive features are seen to be amongst the stickiest. Capitalising on our natural human desire to measure ourselves against other people, features such as discussion forums, bulletin boards and opinion polls evolve as users get involved. Participants return regularly to find out how other users have responded to their comments.. . 5. Games. . Even the simplest online games, crosswords and quizzes can generate compulsive return visits and massively increase the average time a user will spend at a site. Providing a game that your customers love to play generates valuable loyalty to your company and your brand. Word of mouth often spreads quickly and players will visit repeatedly to better their own scores or to beat friends and colleagues. The RSPCA website allows visitors to adopt a cyber pet which sends email updates reminding owners to return to the site to feed, water and care for their pet!. . 6. Links. . It is often difficult to find information on the Internet. If a user knows your site is up to date and well maintained, they will be more inclined to go there first when looking for related information. Including plenty of links to other high quality related websites saves time for your customers and makes your site more valuable.. . 7-10. Other sticky features include…. . …the latest products, regular discounts and special offers, loyalty schemes, free gifts, customer service and troubleshooting via email, job adverts, live news feeds, weather and traffic reports, serialisation of novels or stories, competitions, jokes, horoscopes, free email, online chat rooms and interactive calendars.\"],\n",

Due to the large Albanian diaspora around the world, centuries-old communities speaking Albanian-based dialects can be particularly found scattered in Greece (Arvanitika, Cham), Italy (Arbëreshë), Southern Serbia and in Croatia (Arbanasi). However, the total number of speakers is much higher than the native speakers in Southern Europe. The four dialects include Tosk Albanian, Gheg Albanian, Arbëresh and Arvanitika. Most Albanians are multi-lingual, speaking many regional and foreign languages such as Greek, Italian, Serbo-Croatian, English and others.',\n",

       "  'context': 'In biology, kingdom (Latin: regnum, plural regna) is the second highest taxonomic rank, just below domain. Kingdoms are divided into smaller groups called phyla. Traditionally, some textbooks from the United States used a system of six kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Archaea/Archaeabacteria, and Bacteria/Eubacteria) while textbooks in Great Britain, India, Australia, Latin America and other countries used five kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera). Some recent classifications based on modern cladistics have explicitly abandoned the term \"kingdom\", noting that the traditional kingdoms are not monophyletic, i.e., do not consist of all the descendants of a common ancestor. \\n\\nWhen Carolus Linnaeus introduced the rank-based system of nomenclature into biology in 1735, the highest rank was given the name \"kingdom\" and was followed by four other main or principal ranks: class, order, genus and species. Later two further main ranks were introduced, making the sequence kingdom, phylum or division, class, order, family, genus and species. In the 1960s a rank was introduced above kingdom, namely domain (or empire), so that kingdom is no longer the highest rank. \\n\\nPrefixes can be added so \"subkingdom\" (\"subregnum\") and \"infrakingdom\" (also known as \"infraregnum\") are the two ranks immediately below kingdom. Superkingdom may be considered as an equivalent of domain or empire or as an independent rank between kingdom and domain or subdomain. In some classification systems the additional rank \"branch\" (Latin: \"ramus\") can be inserted between subkingdom and infrakingdom (e.g. Protostomia and Deuterostomia in the classification of Cavalier-Smith).',\n",

       "  'context': 'Colleges taking another look at value of merit-based aid \\n\\nGood grades and high tests scores still matter--a lot--to many colleges as they award financial aid. \\n\\nBut with low-income students projected to make up an ever-larger share of the college-bound population in coming years, some schools are re-examining whether that aid, typically known as \"merit aid\", is the most effective use of precious institutional dollars. \\n\\nGeorge Washington University in Washington, D.C., for example, said last week that it would cut the value of its average merit scholarships by about one-third and reduce the number of recipients , pouring the savings, about $2.5 million, into need-based aid. Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., made a similar decision three years ago. \\n\\nNow, Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., says it will phase out merit scholarships altogether. No current merit-aid recipients will lose their scholarships, but need-based aid alone will be awarded beginning with students entering in fall 2008. \\n\\nNot all colleges offer merit aid; generally, the more selective a school, the less likely it is to do so. Harvard and Princeton, for example, offer generous need-based packages, but many families who don\\'t meet need eligibility have been willing to pay whatever they must for a big-name school. \\n\\nFor small regional colleges that struggle just to fill seats, merit aid can be an important revenue-builder because many recipients still pay enough tuition dollars over and above the scholarship amount to keep the institution running. \\n\\nBut for rankings-conscious schools in between, merit aid has served primarily as a tool to recruit top students and to improve their academic profits. \"They\\'re trying to buy students,\" says Skidmore College economist Sandy Baum. \\n\\nStudies show merit aid also tends to benefit disproportionately students who could afford to enroll without it. \\n\\n\"As we look to the future, we see a more pressing need to invest in need-based aid,\" says Monica Inzer, dean of admission and financial aid at Hamilton, which has offered merit scholarships for 10 years. During that time, it rose in US News & World Report\\'s ranking of the best liberal arts colleges, from 25 to 17. \\n\\nMerit aid, which benefited about 75 students a year, or about 4% of its student body, at a cost of about $ 1 million a year, \"served us well,\" Inzer says, but \"to be discounting the price for families that don\\'t need financial aid doesn\\'t feel right any more.\" \\n\\nNeed-based aid remains by far the largest share of all student aid, which includes state, federal and institutional grants. But merit aid, offered primarily by schools and states, is growing faster, both overall and at the institutional level. \\n\\nBetween 1995-96 and 2003-04, institutional merit aid alone increased 212%, compared with 47% for need-based grants. At least 15 states also offer merit aid, typically in a bid to enroll top students in the state\\'s public institutions. \\n\\nBut in recent years, a growing chorus of critics has begun pressuring schools to drop the practice. Recent decisions by Hamilton and others may be \"a sign that people are starting to realize that there\\'s this destructive competition going on,\" says Baum, co-author of a recent College Report that raises concerns about the role of institutional aid not based on need. \\n\\nDavid Laird, president of the Minnesota Private College Council, says many of his schools would like to reduce their merit aid but fear that in doing so, they would lose top students to their competitors. \\n\\n\"No one can take one-sided action,\" says Laird, who is exploring whether to seek an exemption from federal anti-trust laws so member colleges can discuss how they could jointly reduce merit aid, \"This is a merry-go-round that\\'s going very fast, and none of the institutions believe they can sustain the risks of trying to break away by themselves.\" \\n\\nA complicating factor is that merit aid has become so popular with middle-income families, who don\\'t qualify for need-based aid, that many have come to depend on it. And, as tuitions continue to increase, the line between merit and need blurs. \\n\\nThat\\'s one reason Allegheny College doesn\\'t plan to drop merit aid entirely. \\n\\n\"We still believe in rewarding superior achievements and know that these top students truly value the scholarship,\" says Scott Friedhoff, Allegheny\\'s vice president for enrollment. \\n\\nEmory University in Atlanta, which boasts a $4.7 billion endowment , meanwhile, is taking another approach. This year, it announced it would eliminate loans for needy students and cap them for middle-income families. At the same time, it would expand its 28-year-old merit program. \\n\\n\"Yeah, we\\'re playing the merit game,\" acknowledges Tom Lancaster, associate dean for undergraduate education. But it has its strong point, too, he says. \"The fact of the matter is, it\\'s not just about the lowest-income people. It\\'s the average American middle-class family who\\'s being priced out of the market.\" \\n\\nA few words about merit-based aid: \\n\\nMerit-based aid is aid offered to students who achieve excellence in a given area, and is generally known as academic, athletic and artistic merit scholarships. \\n\\nAcademic merit scholarships are based on students\\' grades, GPA and overall academic performance during high school. They are typically meant for students going straight to college right after high school. However, there are scholarships for current college students with exceptional grades as well. These merit scholarships usually help students pay tuition bills, and they can be renewed each year as long as the recipients continue to qualify. In some cases, students may need to be recommended by their school or a teacher as part of the qualification process. \\n\\nAthletic merit scholarships are meant for students that excel in sports of any kind, from football to track and field events. Recommendation for these scholarships is required, since exceptional athletic performance has to be recognized by a coach or a referee . Applicants need to send in a tape containing their best performance. \\n\\nArtistic merit scholarships require that applicants excel in a given artistic area. This generally includes any creative field such as art, design, fashion, music, dance or writing. Applying for artistic merit scholarships usually requires that students submit a portfolio of some sort, whether that includes a collection of artwork, a recording of a musical performance or a video of them dancing.',\n",

A little further on a street lanthorn was swinging aloft, throwing a small circle of dim, yellowish light on the unpaved street below. By its fitful glimmer Yvonne could vaguely perceive the tall figure of her guide as he stepped out with noiseless yet firm tread, his shoulder brushing against the side of the nearest house as he kept closely within the shadow of its high wall. The sight of his broad back thrilled her. She had fallen to imagining whether this was not perchance that gallant and all-powerful Scarlet Pimpernel himself: the mysterious friend of whom her dear milor so often spoke with an admiration that was akin to worship. He too was probably tall and broad--for English gentlemen were usually built that way; and Yvonne's over-excited mind went galloping on the wings of fancy, and in her heart she felt that she was glad that she had suffered so much, and then lived through such a glorious moment as this. \\n\\nNow from the narrow unpaved yard in front of the house the guide turned sharply to the right. Yvonne could only distinguish outlines. The streets of Nantes were familiar to her, and she knew pretty well where she was.

Today, a plaque in the hospital\\'s entry remembers the place of his birth. Bruce\\'s birth, in the hour and the year of Dragon, is a powerful symbol in Chinese astrology . It would be a strong indication of the powerful life that was to be lived by Bruce Lee and the explosive influence his life would have on countless others. At the age of three months, Lee Hoi Chuen, his wife Grace and baby Bruce returned to Hong Kong where Bruce would be raised until the age of 18. Probably because of the long ocean voyage and the change in climates, Bruce was not a strong child in his very early years, a condition that would change when he took up the study of kung fu at the age of 13. At the age of 13, Bruce was introduced to Master Yip Man, a teacher of the Wing Chun style of kung fu. For five years Bruce studied diligently and became very proficient. Regarding Yip Man as a master teacher and wise man, Bruce respected him greatly and frequently visited with him in later years. When he first took up kung fu, he used his new skills to fight his \"enemies\", but it did not take long for Bruce to learn that the real value of martial arts training is that the skills of physical combat build up confidence to the point that one does not feel the constant need to defend one\\'s honor through fighting. In high school, Bruce, now no longer a weak child, was beginning to improve his body through hard training. One of his accomplishments was winning an interschool Boxing Championship against an English student. Given the graceful movements, which would later be spectacularly displayed in his films, it is no surprise that Bruce was also an excellent dancer, and in 1958 he won the Hong Kong Cha Cha Championship. At the age of 18, Bruce was looking for new prospect in his life, as were his parents who were discouraged that Bruce had not made much progress academically. His family decided that it was time for him to return to the land of his birth and find his future there. In April of 1959, with $100 in his pocket, Bruce boarded a steamship and began his voyage to San Francisco.',\n",

One could not tell whether the reformation would prove permanent. \\n\\n\"After all, I never heard any really serious offense proved against him,\" Colston rejoined. \"It\\'s sometimes easy to acquire a reputation without doing anything in particular to deserve it.

Those living in extreme poverty rose to 15% in 2015, up from 8.9% in 2011, and a huge increase from 2009 when it wasn’t more than 2.2%. Those people at risk for poverty or social exclusion was one in three or 35.7%. The rate among children 0-17 is 17.6% and for young people 18-29 the rate is 24.4%. With unemployment on the rise, those without jobs are at the highest risk at 70-75%, up from less than 50% in 2011. With jobs harder and harder to come by, a quarter of the population is out of work, and for people under 25 the rate is 50%. In some harder hit areas of western Greece, the younger generation unemployment rate is more than 60%. When people are out of work for more than two years, they lose their health insurance, further increasing the problems of those in poverty. When younger people are out of work, they rely on the older generations of their families to provide for them to get them through the hard times. However, long term unemployment across the country causes pension funds to decrease because they are getting less money from the working population, so those older generations are getting less money to provide for the younger generations and their entire families, putting more of them in poverty. Many aspects of the economic problems add to the problem. The Greeks people have continued job loss and wage cuts, as well as deep cuts in workers compensation and social welfare benefits. For those who are working, their wages have dropped. From 2008 to 2013, Greeks have become 40% poorer on average, and in 2014 saw their disposable household income drop below 2003 levels. The Economic Survey of Greece 2016 shows optimism in a stronger recovery in 2017 by using things like the reforms in place and outside investment in jobs to help change the course of the high levels of poverty.',\n",

The Siamese were soundly defeated in the Battle of Tavoy in January 1794 and retreated.

The Burmese king sent a sizeable force  led by Gen. Saw Lagun Ein of Martaban to drive out the Siamese forces from Ye and Tavoy in late 1547. Saw Lagun Ein\\'s forces defeated Siamese forces led by the governor of Kanchanaburi, and retook down to Tavoy. Tabinshwehti was not satisfied, and planned an invasion of Siam itself. Next year, near the end of the rainy season on 14 October 1548, , 12,000 strong Toungoo forces led by Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung invaded Siam via the Three Pagodas Pass. The Burmese forces overcame Siamese defences, and advanced to the capital city of Ayutthaya. But they could not take the heavily fortified city. One month into the siege, in January 1549, Siamese counterattacks broke the siege, and drove back the invasion force. On retreat, the Burmese tried to take Kamphaeng Phet, but it too was well defended by Portuguese mercenaries. Fortunately for the Burmese, they caught two important Siamese nobles  in some open fighting, and negotiated a safe retreat in exchange for the nobles in February 1549.',\n",

In March 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and in doing so agreed to return to the Ottoman Empire territory gained during the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War. These territories were, however, no longer under the functional control of the Russian central government; rather, they were being administered collectively by the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis through the Transcaucasian Sejm. The Trebizond Peace Conference aimed to resolve the dispute, but when the conference failed to produce a resolution, the Ottomans pursued a military campaign to control the disputed territories. Under persistent attack, the Transcaucasian collective eventually dissolved with the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijanis declaring independent nation states in quick succession in late-May 1918. On 4 June, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of Batum with each of the three Transcaucasian states, which brought the conflict to an end and awarded the southern half of the ethnically-Armenian Lori Province and Akhalkalaki district to the Ottomans. Against the wishes of Armenia, Georgia, supported by German officers, took possession of northern Lori and established military outposts along the Dzoraget River. When the Ottomans signed the Armistice of Mudros in October, they were subsequently required to withdraw from the region. Armenia quickly took control of territory previously controlled by the Ottomans, and skirmishes between Armenia and Georgia arose starting on 18 October. Open warfare began in early December, after diplomatic efforts failed to resolve the issue of the disputed border, and continued until 31 December, when a British-brokered ceasefire was signed, leaving the disputed territory under joint Georgian and Armenian administration.',\n",

Howard also provided a 34-yard catch six drives later, which helped lead to Barth kicking a 28-yard field goal in the second quarter. On Chicago\\'s next possession, Howard scored on a two-yard touchdown run. Minnesota came close to scoring a touchdown on the following series, including reaching as far as Chicago\\'s two-yard line, but Bradford was sacked by Akiem Hicks on third down; the Vikings were forced to settle for Blair Walsh\\'s 30-yard field goal. The Bears scored on the first drive of the second half when Cutler threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery to give the Bears a 20-3 lead. Neither team scored on each of their next two drives. With 5:41 left in the game, Bradford threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Stefon Diggs to cut the margin to ten points, but the Bears offense consumed much of the time remaining.

Evans' first-quarter performance was a Buffalo record for a period and just shy of the NFL record for yards receiving in a quarter of 210 by Baltimore's Qadry Ismail in 1999. The first touchdown came after Nate Clements' interception on the third play of the game. Both were after Evans got in front of Texans cornerback Demarcus Faggins for the easy score. The 83-yard TDs were career highs for both Losman and Evans and marked the first time in franchise history the Bills have had two 80-yard passes in a single game. David Carr opened 1 for 3 with an interception on his first pass before completing his next 22 throws. Carr finished 25 of 30 for 223 yards and no touchdowns. Carr tied the record held by Mark Brunell, who had 22 consecutive completions in Washington's 31-15 win over the Texans at Reliant Stadium on September 24. He tied Brunell's record on a short pass to Wali Lundy for no gain with 6:19 left. The streak was broken when his pass to Andre Johnson with 5:44 remaining fell short. Lundy cut the lead to 14-7 with a 17-yard run in the first quarter. That score was set up by a 17-yard reception by Eric Moulds on third-and-8. Samkon Gado made it 17-14 on a 1-yard run in the second quarter. Moulds also had a key third-down reception on that drive. Dunta Robinson gave the Texans the lead on a 9-yard interception return midway through the third quarter. Losman was throwing out of the end zone when Robinson intercepted the pass intended for Evans to score his first career touchdown and the Texans' first defensive touchdown since 2004. But after the offense failed to put the game away in the fourth quarter the Texans gave the Bills just enough time to beat them. Losman hit a diving Peerless Price in the back of the end zone for the 15-yard touchdown with 13 seconds left, giving Buffalo the 24-21 win.\",\n",

       "  'context': \" Benny Bates, a poor boy from the Liverpool slums, is ten years old when the story begins. He scrapes a living running errands in the streets; his beloved but frail sister Nelly, a year younger, sells matches. Their mother is dead, their father a drink-sodden brute. When he becomes violent towards Nelly, the two children run away from home. Helped by their friend the night-watchman Joe Wrag, and 'Granny' Betty Barker, they manage to retain their independence and learn to lead Christian lives. Nelly, a child of great natural spiritual insight, acts as Benny's moral conscience; when she dies after a street accident, he is in despair. A lucky encounter with Eva Lawrence, the little girl he will come to call his 'angel', leads to a job as office-boy to her father, a rich Liverpool businessman. Benny works hard, hoping to educate and better himself, but loses both job and reputation when Mr. Lawrence wrongly accuses him of stealing a five-pound note. Abandoning Liverpool, he nearly dies of starvation and heat-stroke, but is rescued and nursed back to health by a kindly farming family. He remains with them, working on the farm and studying in night school. Six years later, and by now grown up, he bravely stops a runaway carriage in a nearby lane; only afterwards does he discover that one of its occupants was Eva Lawrence. Benny has saved his 'angel's' life; now she reveals that she and her father have long known that he was innocent of the theft. The grateful Mr. Lawrence offers Benny a new job, this time as his clerk; he returns to Liverpool, to work his way up into partnership with Mr. Lawrence, and marriage with Eva.\",\n",

Never having boarders before, the Liscom family, accepted the Jamesons when they came to town in search for a place to stay. Their arrival caused a great commotion as the Jamesons son, Cobb, saw smoke inside his new temporary residence and proceeded to run outside and yell “Fire!” Word quickly traveled down the street and a crowd formed outside the Liscom's as firemen drenched the entire house. Mrs. Caroline Liscom was furious that her house was soaked with water when the smoke was only caused by her chimney, and as a result was rude to her new boarders. Mrs. Jameson tried to find a new place to live in response to her host's rudeness, but had no such luck and both families were forced to live under the roof for the next several weeks.\\nThe Jamesons consisted of a mother, a father, two daughters, one son and a grandmother. Mrs. Jameson quickly gave her family a bad reputation at a Linnville annual picnic several days after her arrival. She made an announcement to the village that their unhealthy foods were “poison” and further insults them as she says that their rich pies and cakes causes the insanity and dyspepsia in people of their social class, so they should only eat the health foods she consumes. In attempt to avoid an altercation, the people of Linnville respond as politely as possible and continue on with the picnic as though nothing happened.\\nMrs. Jameson proceeds to insult the women of the village at their next meeting - the Ladies' Sewing Circle. It is at this meeting that the women become aware that Mrs. Jameson is trying to improve the women as she interrupts the meeting to “improve their minds and enlarge their spheres” by reading passages from Robert Browning. The women are not entertained by her reading, but once again are respectful when she is done lecturing them.\\nSeveral weeks later, the Jamesons return to the city for the winter and the next chapter begins their second summer in Linnville. For their second summer, they purchase their own home and farm to run. Mrs. Jameson is clueless as to how a farm should be run, and as a result is the victim of some tricks when purchasing animals for the barn. Besides the barn, there are some other changes Mrs. Jameson has made herself and she tries to impose them on the community, as she did with her health foods the previous summer. First, she stops wearing the fancy city clothes she had worn in the past and begins wearing what she thinks is most practical for a country person to wear. She proceeds to insult and instruct the other women to adopt the same style as her. Some women do follow her, but many do not.\\nMrs. Jameson continues to make bold statements against the traditions of Linnville and paints her house red with dark shutters, while every other house is white with green shutters. She then decides that the town would look better if the houses had ivy growing on them, and plants ivy around everyone's homes, without their permission. It is later discovered this ivy is poison ivy and she has to go back to the houses and remove it all. She tries to change the interiors of people's homes as well by getting rid of framed-coffin plates of deceased loved ones in the parlors, a common décor in the homes of Linnville.\\nWith every act against the norms of Linnville, Mrs. Jameson gets more and more enemies. She is so distracted with trying to “improve” Linnville that she does not notice that one of her daughters is in a clandestine relationship with the Liscom boy, who Mrs. Jameson does not approve of due to his family's inferior social standing to her own. Eventually, the young lovers are caught, and both of their mothers are furious. Mrs. Liscom does not approve of Harriett Jameson because she is not trained in housekeeping. An expected turn of events leads Mrs. Liscom to adore Harriett though, and the two get married at the end of the novel.\\nThe unexpected change occurs during a Centennial party that Mrs. Jameson organizes for the town's 100th birthday. She collects the oldest furniture from houses all around the town and decorates the oldest house in town with all of it. She invites celebrities with connections to Linnville, organizes a parade, and sets up a dinner with speeches from honorable people. The event goes well and many people have a newfound respect for Mrs. Jameson but towards the end, Harriett's dress catches on fire, putting an end to the celebration. It is Mrs. Liscom who saves Harriett, and from that moment on they become very close to each other. Harriett does not suffer from any severe wounds, and takes housekeeping lessons from Mrs. Liscom until the wedding. Mrs. Jameson accepts Harry Liscom as her son-in-law as well and in the end, people learn to love the Jameson family collectively and are happy they came to town, despite the drama they brought along with them.\",\n",

He wants no part in the rebellion, but while attending to some of the rebels wounded at the Battle of Sedgemoor, Peter is arrested. During the Bloody Assizes, he is convicted by the infamous Judge Jeffreys of treason on the grounds that \"if any person be in actual rebellion against the King, and another personâ\\x80\\x94who really and actually was not in rebellionâ\\x80\\x94does knowingly receive, harbour, comfort, or succour him, such a person is as much a traitor as he who indeed bore arms.\"\\nThe sentence for treason is death by hanging, but King James II, for purely financial reasons, has the sentence for Blood and other convicted rebels commuted to transportation to the Caribbean, where they are to be sold into slavery. Upon arrival on the island of Barbados, Blood is bought by Colonel Bishop, initially for work in the Colonel\\'s sugar plantations but later hired out by Bishop when Blood\\'s skills as a physician prove superior to those of the local doctors. During his period of slavery, Blood becomes acquainted with and even friendly with Arabella Bishop, Colonel Bishop\\'s niece, who becomes sympathetic after learning his history.\\nWhen a Spanish force attacks and raids the town of Bridgetown, Blood escapes with a number of other convict-slaves (including former shipmaster Jeremy Pitt, the one-eyed giant Edward Wolverstone, former gentleman Nathaniel Hagthorpe, former Royal Navy petty officer Nicholas Dyke and former Royal Navy master gunner Ned Ogle), captures the Spaniards\\' ship and sails away to become one of the most successful pirates in the Caribbean, hated and feared by the Spanish and always sparing English ships. Colonel Bishop, humiliated by Blood\\'s escape and by Blood himself, devotes himself to capturing Blood with the hope of hanging him.\\nAfter the Glorious Revolution, Blood is pardoned. As a reward for saving the colony of Jamaica from a French assault, he is appointed its governor in place of Colonel Bishop, who had abandoned his post to hunt for Blood, and the novel ends with the implication that Blood will not only marry Colonel Bishop\\'s niece Arabella but will also let Bishop off easy.',\n",

       "  'context': ' On a cold day the fictional 304th New York Regiment awaits battle beside a river. Eighteen-year-old Private Henry Fleming, remembering his romantic reasons for enlisting as well as his mother\\'s resulting protests, wonders whether he will remain brave in the face of fear, or turn and run. He is comforted by one of his friends from home, Jim Conklin, who admits that he would run from battle if his fellow soldiers also fled. During the regiment\\'s first battle, Confederate soldiers charge, but are repelled. The enemy quickly regroups and attacks again, this time forcing some of the unprepared Union soldiers to flee. Fearing the battle is a lost cause, Henry deserts his regiment. It is not until after he reaches the rear of the army that he overhears a general announcing the Union\\'s victory.\\nAshamed, Henry escapes into a nearby forest, where he discovers a decaying body in a peaceful clearing. In his distress, he hurriedly leaves the clearing and stumbles upon a group of injured men returning from battle. One member of the group, a \"tattered soldier\", asks Henry where he is wounded, but the youth dodges the question. Among the group is Jim Conklin, who has been shot in the side and is suffering delirium from blood-loss. Jim eventually dies of his injury, defiantly resisting aid from his friend, and an enraged and helpless Henry runs from the wounded soldiers. He next joins a retreating column that is in disarray. In the ensuing panic, a man hits Henry on the head with his rifle, wounding him. Exhausted, hungry, thirsty, and now wounded, Henry decides to return to his regiment regardless of his shame. When he arrives at camp, the other soldiers believe his injury resulted from a grazing bullet during battle. The other men care for the youth, dressing his wound.\\nThe next morning Henry goes into battle for the third time. His regiment encounters a small group of Confederates, and in the ensuing fight Henry proves to be a capable soldier, comforted by the belief that his previous cowardice had not been noticed, as he \"had performed his mistakes in the dark, so he was still a man\". Afterward, while looking for a stream from which to obtain water with a friend, he discovers from the commanding officer that his regiment has a lackluster reputation. The officer speaks casually about sacrificing the 304th because they are nothing more than \"mule drivers\" and \"mud diggers.\" With no other regiments to spare, the general orders his men forward.\\nIn the final battle, Henry acts as the flag-bearer after the color sergeant falls. A line of Confederates hidden behind a fence beyond a clearing shoots with impunity at Henry\\'s regiment, which is ill-covered in the tree-line. Facing withering fire if they stay and disgrace if they retreat, the officers order a charge. Unarmed, Henry leads the men while entirely escaping injury. Most of the Confederates run before the regiment arrives, and four of the remaining men are taken prisoner. The novel closes with the following passage:\\nIt rained. The procession of weary soldiers became a bedraggled train, despondent and muttering, marching with churning effort in a trough of liquid brown mud under a low, wretched sky. Yet the youth smiled, for he saw that the world was a world for him, though many discovered it to be made of oaths and walking sticks. He had rid himself of the red sickness of battle. The sultry nightmare was in the past. He had been an animal blistered and sweating in the heat and pain of war. He turned now with a lover\\'s thirst to images of tranquil skies, fresh meadows, cool brooks, an existence of soft and eternal peace.\\nOver the river a golden ray of sun came through the hosts of leaden rain clouds.',\n",

Wells' The War of the Worlds, though in both works the onslaught is thwarted when the aliens die from bacterial illness. Determining that the Martians will inevitably return, Earth's leaders, including U.S. President William McKinley, Queen Victoria, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and Emperor Mutsuhito, unite the world against the common threat and plan an attack on Mars. American inventor Thomas Edison leads a group of scientists studying derelict Martian equipment; they are able to develop an anti-gravity device powered by electric repulsion as well as a disintegration ray.\\nUsing this new technology, the allies construct an armada of space ships for the attack. Edison takes some ships to the moon on a test run; using the first known fictional depiction of space suits, the explorers uncover evidence of an extinct civilization of giants. The armada heads on, discovering a solid gold asteroid being mined by the Martians. The humans fight two space battles against the Martians, suffering heavy casualties but ultimately winning thanks to the superiority of Edison's ray gun compared to the Martians' electric weapons. The humans take a captive, from whom they learn the Martian language.\\nThe humans reach Mars, but in spite of their superior forces they have lost half their men to the Martians' overwhelming numbers. The Martians envelop the planet in a smoke screen, and the humans retreat to the moon Deimos. During a raid on Mars for supplies, the earth men find Aina, the last of a population of human slaves whose ancestors were captured from Kashmir in a Martian raid 9,000 years before. During this raid, the Martians also constructed the Great Pyramids and the Great Sphynx in Egypt, the latter of which is a statue of their leader. Aina advises Edison that meeting the Martians in battle would be fruitless, and that they should instead attack the dams that channel water from the polar ice. Since most of Mars' cities are under sea level, the flood spreads rapidly, killing most of the Martians and destroying their civilization. Edison and company force a peace with the surviving Martians, and return home to great celebration.\",\n",

Committing pseudocide may be done for a variety of reasons, such as to fraudulently collect insurance money, to evade pursuit, to escape from captivity, to arouse false sympathy, or as a practical joke. While faking one's own death is not inherently illegal, it may be part of a fraudulent activity such as tax evasion or insurance fraud.\",\n",

       "  'context': \" Robert Rath (Sylvester Stallone) is a paid assassin who wants nothing more than to get out of 'the business', haunted by the memory of murdering his own mentor Nicolai years ago. Rath is a quiet, morose professional who is on an assignment to kill someone when someone else gets to the 'mark' (the target) before he does. That person turns out to be Miguel Bain (Antonio Banderas), a fellow assassin and a competitive sociopath.\\nAs Rath tries to figure out who sent Bain, the contractor offers him one last job that could financially allow him to retire: killing a computer hacker named Electra (Julianne Moore) and the four Dutch buyers of a disk that contains sensitive information and Rath has to retrieve. However, Electra has set up cameras in all the rooms of the apartment block where she lives and watches them like watching television.\\nBain first kills the four Dutch buyers who turn out to be Interpol agents, but when Rath comes to kill Electra, for the first time he has a change of heart. His pay for the job is given to him in a briefcase in exchange for the disk. But the briefcase actually contains a bomb placed by his own contractor in an attempt to kill him. Luckily, Electra had swapped the disk, not sure if Rath was coming back or not.\\nThe contractor takes the chance and hires Bain to terminate him; now having become a target along with Electra he must try and extract enough money out of his contractor so he can disappear for good, while avoiding the bloodthirsty Bain. Rath's contractor turns out to be none other than Nicolai himself who also hired Bain to track down Electra and the disk.\\nNicolai revealed he had a vest on when Rath shot him years ago and faked his death ever since. Knowing that Nicolai would kill him too, Bain, along with Rath, shot him dead. Bain plans to kill Rath to be the number one assassin. But Electra puts on her sunglasses to allow Rath to see Bain. Rath shot Bain through his jacket killing him.\",\n",

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography were performed before surgery in 110 patients with 124 pulmonary nodules smaller than 3 cm, including 96 non-small cell lung cancers and 28 benign nodules. Diffusion of water molecules in magnetic resonance imaging was measured by minimum value of apparent diffusion coefficient. The criterion standard was the result of histologic diagnosis or follow-up examination. Sensitivity and specificity for differentiating between cancers and benign nodules were compared between diffusion-weighted imaging and positron emission tomography. Apparent diffusion coefficient in diffusion-weighted imaging and fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake in positron emission tomography were examined with respect to pathologic tumor stage; lymphatic, vascular and pleural involvements; and histologic differentiation. There were no significant differences between diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography in sensitivity or specificity for non-small cell lung cancer. Whereas positron emission tomography showed significant differences in fludeoxyglucose F 18 uptake between pathologic stages IA versus IB or more advanced stages; between tumors with and without lymphatic, vascular, or pleural involvement; and between well-differentiated and moderately or poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas (P<.01-0.001), no significant differences in apparent diffusion coefficient values in were observed.',\n",

Teleconsulting through mobile laptop computers may offer more flexibility compared with hospital-based services, but concerns about quality and technical reliability remain. We conducted a controlled trial, allocating hospital-based or mobile teleconsulting in a shift-by-shift sequence and evaluating technical parameters, acceptability, and impact on immediate clinical decisions. Both types of telemedicine workstations were equipped with DICOM (Digital-Imaging-and-Communications-in-Medicine) viewer and videoconference software. The laptop connected by asymmetrical broadband UMTS (Universal-Mobile-Telecommunication-Systems) technology with a one-way spoke-to-hub video transmission, whereas the hospital-based device used landline symmetrical telecommunication, including a 2-way videoconference. One hundred twenty-seven hospital-based and 96 mobile teleconsultations were conducted within 2 months without any technical breakdown. The rates per allocated time were similar with 3.8 and 4.0 per day. No significant differences were found for durations of videoconference (mean: 11+/-3 versus 10+/-3 minutes, P=0.07), DICOM download (3+/-3 versus 4+/-3 minutes, P=0.19), and total duration of teleconsultations (44+/-19 versus 45+/-21 minutes, P=0.98). Technical quality of mobile teleconsultations was rated worse on both sides, but this did not affect the ability to make remote clinical decisions like initiating thrombolysis (17% versus 13% of all, P=0.32).',\n",

We hypothesized that obesity contributes to workplace injury and tested the hypothesis using logistic regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE) and random-effects logistic regression. To ensure temporal precedence of obesity, we used the obesity level in each previous wave and examined its association with injury outcome in each wave from 1988-2000.

Failure to reduce the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) with increasing device speeds in a ramp test is predictive of pump obstruction. Aortic insufficiency (AI) or increased MAP can diminish the ability to unload the left ventricle. LVEDD was plotted against device speed, and a linear function slope was calculated. A flat LVEDD slope (≥-0.16) was considered abnormal (suggestive of obstruction). Ramp test results were compared in patients with or without either AI or increased MAP at baseline speed, and receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for predictors of device obstruction. Device thrombosis was confirmed by direct visualization of clot at explantation or on inspection by the manufacturer. Of 78 ramp tests (55 patients), 36 were abnormal (18 true positive, 18 false positive), and 42 were normal (37 true negative, 5 false negative). In patients with AI, LVEDD slope was -0.14 ± 0.17, which was consistent with device obstruction (vs. -0.25 ± 0.11 in patients without AI; p<0.001), despite no difference in mean lactate dehydrogenase concentration between the 2 groups (1,301 ± 1,651 U/l vs. 1,354 ± 1,365 U/l; p = 0.91). Area under the ROC curve (AUC) for LVEDD slope was 0.76 and improved to 0.88 after removal of patients with AI from the study. LVEDD slope in patients with MAP ≥85 mm Hg was similar to that for device obstruction (-0.18 ± 0.07) and was abnormal in 6 of the 12 ramp tests performed. Combining LVEDD slope with lactate dehydrogenase concentration increased the AUC to 0.96 as an indicator of device obstruction.',\n",

       "  'context': \"Janet Jeppson began dating Isaac Asimov in 1970 immediately following his separation from Gertrude Blugerman. They were married on November 30, 1973, two weeks after Asimov's divorce from Gertrude. Despite Jeppson's upbringing in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, their marriage was officiated by a leader of Ethical Culture, a humanist religious group that Janet later joined. On the same day, she learned that her first novel, The Second Experiment, would be published (under her maiden name). Their marriage lasted until Isaac's death in 1992 from complications relating to HIV, contracted from a 1983 blood transfusion during bypass surgery. Janet reportedly consulted medical texts after Isaac began exhibiting symptoms, and she requested an HIV test be performed. His doctors insisted she was wrong and only tested Isaac for the infection after he became seriously ill. She wanted the information made public, but doctors insisted upon not disclosing it, even after Isaac died. After the doctors advising silence had all died, Janet Asimov went public with the knowledge.\",\n",

The following year, the band became involved in a prolific marketing phenomenon, leading to an unprecedented number of Spice Girls merchandise and sponsorship deals. With their name attached to numerous sponsors including Pepsi, Cadbury and Polaroid, and the official Spice Girls branding on hundreds of different product tie-ins, they quickly became the most merchandised group in music history. Their global merchandising efforts alone brought in over £300 million in 1997, while the group\\'s total grosses were estimated at US$500–800 million by May 1998. Industry pundits attribute much of the success of the Spice Girls\\' brand to the group\\'s longtime manager Simon Fuller. By the end of 1997 however, the overwhelming number of Spice Girls merchandise and sponsorship deals led to a public and media backlash. The group responded by firing Fuller and slowing down, but not stopping, their marketing pursuits. The Spice Girls eventually disbanded in 2000, but the marketing phenomenon they created in the 1990s has had a lasting influence on the modern music industry.',\n",

It stars American actor Anthony Quinn and Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida. The film is the first version of the novel to be made in color. In the tradition of many sword and sandal spectacles, Quinn and Lollobrigida are the only two actors in the film who actually speak in English; the rest of the cast is made up of French actors who have had their voices dubbed into English. Anthony Quinn's portrayal of the hunchback Quasimodo is more human and less horrific than most other portrayals. Instead of having a huge hump and a hideously deformed face, he only has a small curve in his spine and a slightly deformed face.\",\n",

Besides Frege and Russell, others credited with having ideas preceding truth tables include Philo, Boole, Charles Sanders Peirce, and Ernst Schröder. Others credited with the tabular structure include Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred North Whitehead, William Stanley Jevons, John Venn, and Clarence Irving Lewis.

       "  'context': '(CNN) -- My dad told me real men don\\'t hit women. He believed that because men were physically stronger and mentally tougher, men had the obligation to shield women from harm. I didn\\'t buy the mentally tougher part, but I did embrace the idea that men were born with a kind of wonderful genetic code that made it impossible for them to pummel any woman, least of all a woman they cherished. I believed this all the way through grade school and high school. I believed it until my college boyfriend, in a jealous rage, threw me against the wall and knocked me out. It only happened once, but I remember how it felt. I always thought I was a physically strong woman, but I could not defend myself against a man who outweighed me by 70 pounds. Which brings me to star running back Ray Rice. When video emerged of the Baltimore Ravens player dragging his unconscious fiancÃ©e from an elevator, I thought the whole world would be horrified. I thought the National Football League would come down hard on Rice. Rice indicted on assault charge . I was wrong. Rice will sit out two games and pay a fine. It reportedly will cost the multimillionaire athlete $529,411.24. The Ravens\\' head coach, John Harbaugh, summed it up this way on ESPN: . \"It\\'s not a big deal. It\\'s just part of the process. We said from the beginning that the circumstances would determine the consequences. There are consequences when you make a mistake like that. I stand behind Ray. He\\'s a heck of a guy. He\\'s done everything right since. He makes a mistake. He\\'s going to have to pay a consequence.\" (In May, Rice pleaded not guilty to one count of third-degree aggravated assault and was accepted into a pretrial program for first offenders.) Plus, come on! The guy went to counseling and married his victim, for goodness sake. Say what? In a wonderfully headlined post, \"The NFL Thinks Smoking Weed Is Eight Times Worse Than Beating a Woman Unconscious,\" the website sports.mic contrasted Rice\\'s situation with that of Josh Gordon, a wide receiver for the Cleveland Browns, who \"is facing a 16-game suspension ... for testing positive for marijuana ...\" Actually this strange kind of \"justice\" meted out by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell doesn\\'t bother me as much as what the Ravens posted on their Twitter feed. According to whoever tweets for the Ravens, Janay Rice herself \"deeply regrets the role she played the night of the incident.\" Perhaps the new Mrs. Rice really does feel that way, but the Ravens\\' \"helpful\" tweet is as tone deaf as John Harbaugh\\'s Rice \"made a mistake/he\\'s a heck of a guy\" comment. Ayonna Johnson, director of legal services for the Women\\'s Resource Center to End Domestic Violence, says, \"When it comes to ... professional sports, unfortunately we\\'re still in a male-dominant society.\" A girlfriend or a wife, she says, \"has to bend themselves down, bend herself lower, and make her partner and her love interest shine a little brighter.\" Even when her manly, wealthy, successful husband is clearly wrong. Put more bluntly, take the blame, Honey, you probably deserved it. I don\\'t say that lightly. After my boyfriend knocked me out, I expected my friends to rally around me. Most did not. \"He\\'s such a nice guy,\" they told me in disbelief. \"You must have made him really mad. You say some mean stuff. He really loves you.\" ESPN\\'s Stephen Smith played the role of my callous former friends on his show, \"First Take.\" He assured his audience that, PERSONALLY, \"as a man raised by women,\" he knows full well there\\'s never an \"excuse to put your hands on a woman,\" except, that is, when you must. Smith blathered, \"We also have to make sure that we learn as much as we can about elements of provocation.\" In other words, Ladies, don\\'t provoke your man or he\\'ll deck you. Smith\\'s colleague -- and my new hero -- Michelle Beadle tweeted, \"I\\'m thinking about wearing a miniskirt this weekend ... I\\'d hate to think what I\\'d be asking for by doing so.\" Smith tried to apologize, but the damage was done. Perhaps the NFL will try to apologize too, but again, the damage is done. So, Mr. Goodell, a few facts for you to ponder for the future: According to safehorizon.org, one in four women will experience domestic violence during her lifetime. One-third of female homicide victims are killed by their current or former partner. According to the Coalition Against Domestic Violence, boys who witness domestic abuse are twice as likely to abuse their own partners and children when they become adults. It\\'s why I thank God every day I married a man whose father was as old-fashioned as mine. Gordon Snyder taught his sons a slightly different version, though. Gordy said, \"A man who hits a woman never hits a man.\" Are you listening, Mr. Goodell?',\n",

       "  'context': \"Seven of 15 men detained during Sydney's terror raids were members of a Muslim street preaching group, \\xa0led by wanted terrorist Mohammad Al Baryalei, it has been claimed. The men were volunteers for the Parramatta Street Dawah group, which 'reverts' random members of the public to Islam in spontaneous ceremonies on the street, according to\\xa0Fairfax reports. The local council, assisted by police, had recently banned the group from operating on the streets of Parramatta in Sydney's west, after the council received complaints that the group was preaching and handing out pamphlets. The manager of Parramatta Mosque, Neil El-Kadomi confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the seven young men who were detained prayed at Parramatta mosque, and were often seen professing their faith on the streets. Mr El-Kadomi is shocked at their arrest, telling Daily Mail that the young men were 'very nice men, just normal kids.' 'You saw them in the street and in the mosque and they were very nice young men,' said Mr El-Kadomi. It is alleged that five members from the western-Sydney based movement have been killed whilst fighting in Syria and Iraq, with 'many more' still overseas as soldiers for the Islamic State. Scroll down for video . Police allege Baryalei was the catalyst behind last Thursday's counter-terrorism raids that saw more than 800 police raid multiple homes in Sydney and Brisbane . A friend of the detained men claim they were only targeted by police because of their association with the Dawah group. 'They're all good friends and a close-knit group,' a friend of the group told Sun Herald. 'But none of the guys are extreme or violent. They were raided because of their association with Baryalei and the Dawah group.' It's claimed that one of the group's former leaders is wanted terrorist Mohammad Ali Baryalei. Baryalei was allegedly the ringleader behind a plot to\\xa0execute\\xa0a random Australian, which sparked counter-terrorism raids last Thursday. The raids were insitgated when police allegedly intercepted a phone call from Baryalei to Sydney 22-year-old Omarjan Azari, which detailed the plot to execute a random Australian on camera. Omarjan's brothers Samim and Waris were also detained during the raids but released without charge. Baryalei is captured in YouTube videos, undertaking his responsibilities with Parramatta Street Dawah group. There are reports almost half of the men detained during Sydney's terror raids were members of a Muslim street preaching group, led by wanted terrorist Mohammad Al Baryalei (pictured) He left Australia in April last year to the Turkey-Syria border, where he has been responsible for recruiting and moving around half of the 60 Australians fighting with terrorists groups in Syria and Iraq. Three other Parramatta Street Dawah preachers are amongst those who have died in the past two years in Syria in the war zone, as part of the fanatical ISIL militant movement. The deceased Australians include Ahmad Moussalli, Sheik Mustapha al Majzoub, Yusuf Ali and Ali's wife Amira Karroum, . When Sheik Mustapha al Majzoub died in Syria in August of 2012, the Street Dawah Australia Facebook page posted a tribute to the man they called 'Our Beloved Brother/Teacher.' Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is now Australia's most senior Islamic State leader,\\xa0worked as a spruiker outside a Kings Cross strip club before he turned to radical Islam . The Street Dawah movement has been coined 'a key breeding ground for radical young Sydneysiders'. Since June 2012, the group has operated out of Parramatta as part of the international Street Dawah movement, 'spreading the blessing of Allah.' Police claim Baryalei is still a major influence on the Dawah members in Sydney. They are believed to have around 12 thousand supporters. Mr El-Kadomi says the adherents at Parramatta Mosque respect what the police are doing, and will be happy to cooperate with authorities if they communicate more efficiently. 'The government and the police is not doing enough to come and talk to the community and explain what's going on,' said Mr El-Kadomi. 'We love to help the government.' Mr El-Kadomi of the Parramatta Mosque insists adherents at the Mosque are proud Australians, helping to build the country and respectful of the police operation. 'Here, we are Muslim Australians. We are Australians as much as any other Australian,' said Mr El-Kadomi . 'We love our country. We help in building Australia. 'We are a normal good citizen in Australia so we need everybody to respect us as much as we respect others.' Neighbours of Baryalei's mum told\\xa0The Australian she had no idea her son was involved with militant groups until police raided their family home at Quakers Hill last December. 'She thought her son was over there studying,' the neighbour said. 'After her house was raided, she said they must be mistaken, her son would never do anything wrong.' Baryalei is believed to be currently in the Syrian city of Raqqa in a protected location, according to the newspaper. The Australian Federal Police have an arrest warrant out for Baryalei. Baryalei, pictured with\\xa0US-Australian citizen Tyler Casey (back) who was killed in Syria in January, is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians believed to be fighting for the Islamic State in the Middle East . Mohammad Ali Baryalei was featured in a number of YouTube videos attempting to convert random Australians to Islam.

There are two variations; a regular (engineering) tricorder and a medical tricorder. Medical tricorders are used to wirelessly scan a patient, either in a ‘sick bay’ on a star ship or during an away mission. The scanning tool can determine a patient’s medical status, and allows doctors to quickly and easily diagnose their condition without an intensive or invasion examination. The technology was developed by Scandu's chief executive Walter De Brouwer, 56, at Nasa’s Ames Research Centre in California. It contains a variety of different sensors, alongside a microphone on the top of the gadget, that can read five vital signs. These include body temperature, heart rate, oximetry (blood oxygen levels), heart rate variability and pulse wave transit time (PWTT) - the time it takes for a heartbeat to reach somewhere else in a person’s body. PWTT is related to blood pressure. Its makers claim the device is 99 per cent accurate in less than 10 seconds. Davantri tricorder is shown on the left while the ScaNurse is on the right.

Now researchers are creating real-life versions . When it is being used a few times every day, the battery lasts for about a week, the firm says. Another device by London-based, ScanNurse, uses computer-vision techniques to analyse images taken with a camera. They hope their system will make observations of the inside of the ears or throat, say – in the same way a doctor would – and then feed it into a computer for analysis. Other teams are using blood and urine samples to test for key markers. The tiny microfluidic devices will, they claim, work in a similar way to hospital-lab tests. DMI, for instance, has teamed teamed up with Nasa to create a device that astronauts could use to monitor their health on long trips and in zero gravity. Doctors and medical engineers point out that much of the technology is already proven available to use separately. For instance, light sensors can now track blow flow and oxygen levels within the human body. Other sensors can be used to detect gases in breath that may indicate certain diseases. A real-life tricorder may not be as far away as people think. The challenge, now, will be to bring all of these elements together into one device.

A Romanian Big Issue seller who stole £50 from a blind pensioner lives in a four-bedroom terraced house worth £250,000. Razvan Dumitru snatched five £10 notes from 66-year-old Jane Phillips’s purse as she tried to give him £1 so he could buy something to eat. Nearby shoppers held the 22-year-old until police arrived. Miss Phillips revealed that the same\\xa0 man had stolen money from her before but that she had forgiven him and given him more money because she thought he was homeless. But last night it emerged that Dumitru and his family live on a smart street in Edmonton, North London, where properties typically sell for more than a quarter of a million pounds. In November 2011, their house was offered for rent at £1,600 a month and described by letting agents as ‘immaculate’, with ‘three double rooms, one en suite, two bathrooms, good-size garden, large reception and newly fitted kitchen’. Big Issue sellers must be homeless, in temporary accommodation or facing financial crisis to be allowed to sell the magazine, but neighbours said Dumitru and his family had lived in the property for some two years.

Dozens of Neapolitans laid siege to the camp, pelting residents with rocks before being restrained by the police. The following day dozens of the inhabitants of the Poggioreale site, on the eastern outskirts of Naples, decamped. A Roma gypsy camp just outside Naples was attacked after a young Italian girl claimed that she had been attacked by two members of the community .

Entire families fled the site in vans, apparently fearing further attacks. A 16-year old Italian girl had returned home in a state of agitation, complaining of the alleged attack by two Roma, around 9pm on Tuesday night. She was taken to hospital in a state of shock. Relatives of the girl headed for the camp with the intention of ‘punishing’ the perpetrators, before exchanging blows with Roma, leaving them injured. The Roma Gypsy camp just outside of Naples had already come under fire from critics because of claims that it was unhygienic . But hours later they returned, flanked by the vigilante mob, threatening fires and launching rocks at the campsite. The site's 250 inhabitants were forced to put up road blocks to defend themselves, and the police eventually managed to restore order. The camp, which has been in that location for four years has already been the focus of protests by locals because of poor hygiene conditions. In 2010 police arrested 18 mafia suspects over an arson attack on the encampment. In January the mayor ordered the camp's removal. Municipal leader Armando Coppola said the girl had suffered an attempted rape but had managed to escape. He added: 'Residents have already had to put up with thefts and obscene acts by the gypsies who are inclined to urinate in the street. 'But this episode triggered a violent reaction.

Although some thunderstorms are approaching from the west, they should not drop enough rain to refill the receding currents of the the Mississippi or Missouri Rivers at St. Louis, according to CNN\\'s weather unit. Downstream on the Mississippi, at Cape Girardeau, water arriving from St. Louis is expected to push the river\\'s level to 45 feet, according to the National Weather Service. At currently just over 43 feet, it stands 11 feet above flood stage there. Levee breaches . A 100- to 150-foot section of levee gave way outside West Alton, Missouri, Tuesday near the point where the Missouri River joins the Mississippi, St. Charles County\\'s emergency management office reported. Residents of an estimated 43 homes in the area were told to evacuate. The levee failed around noon (1 p.m. ET). By evening, authorities were scrambling to bolster about a three-quarter-mile section of levee near Portage des Sioux, about nine miles upstream from West Alton. The area is home to a nearly 1,000-megawatt coal-burning power plant, and officials were hauling truckloads of stone and heavy earth-moving equipment to the site in an attempt to prevent the levee from failing. On Monday emergency teams rushed to get hundreds of people to safety, after a levee breach on the Missouri River near West Alton. Many residents didn\\'t need to be told twice to get out. \"I want to be safe rather than sorry,\" Heather Wendle said. \"I don\\'t want to take the chances.\" From trickle to torrent . After weeks of heavy rain in the upper Midwest, the Mississippi is still running above flood stage at St. Louis, in spite of dropping water levels, the Corps of Engineers reported. The flood waters stand in contrast to the near river drought a few months ago. The Mississippi had been running so low that the Corps feared it would have to close the waterway to barge traffic. In December, the Corps of Engineers had hundreds of tons of rock dug out of the river at Thebes, Illinois, about 125 miles downriver from St. Louis, to make sure barges could pass. But Monday, the Coast Guard shut down a section of the river at St. Louis -- because the water was too high for safe navigation.

At its steepest Jenkin Road has a 33 per cent maximum gradient and comes towards the end of a gruelling day of cycling. Ready to go: Leeds gets ready for the start of the Tour de France . Pride of Britain: The riders will go through the picturesque Yorkshire Dales . It is only 800m long but the ramp is so severe and arrives so late in the day that it will provide the perfect platform for late attack to try and win the stage. It will be a good place for spectators to watch as the severity of the climb will mean the cyclists will be moving very slowly as they make their way to the top of the hill. At the end of the Tour the winner of the Yellow Jersey and King of the Mountains will be remembered, but maybe there should also be a prize for the conqueror of Jenkin Road.',\n",

       "  'context': 'By . Fiona Macrae . Breakthrough: A new test can more reliably diagnose prostate cancer AND tell how big the tumour is - without the need for a rectal examination . Scroll down for video . A cheap, easy and accurate test for prostate cancer could be in surgeries within months. Studies show the new urine test to be twice as reliable as the existing blood test for detecting the disease – the most common cancer among British men. It also tells doctors how serious the cancer is. This means it should not only save lives but also spare men painful, embarrassing and unnecessary tests and treatments. The new test – described as potentially the biggest breakthrough in prostate cancer diagnosis in 25 years – does not involve a rectal examination. It is likely to cost as little as £10 a patient, and the price tag, combined with its accuracy and simplicity, could even lead to all older men being screened for the disease, as women are for breast cancer. The test’s Surrey University creators have struck a deal with two companies and it is hoped it will be in doctors’ surgeries later this year. Private patients will be the first to benefit but NHS use could follow. Inventor Hardev Pandha, a professor of medical oncology, said: ‘This new test could lead to faster detection that could save hundreds of lives and also offers the potential for huge cost savings.’ Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in British men, killing nearly 11,000 people a year, and doctors do not have a 100 per cent accurate way of spotting it. The blood test routinely used measures levels of a protein called prostate specific antigen, or PSA, but it is wrong more often than it is right. This means many men are subjected to the pain, worry and embarrassment of unnecessary biopsies. In other cases, fledgling cancers are missed until they have spread elsewhere in the body and are harder to treat. The new test uses a urine sample, dispensing with the need for needles. It searches the urine for a protein called EN2, which is not made by healthy people but is pumped out by tumours. In trials, it detected about 70 per cent of prostate cancers, making it twice as accurate as the PSA test. But the test has a second advantage. Unlike PSA, the amount of EN2 in urine corresponds with the size of the tumour. This . is important because prostate cancer is not always life-threatening. It . often grows slowly and does not always need to be treated straight . away. Many men with tumours . that will do them little harm are subjected to surgery and radiotherapy, . both of which carry a high risk of incontinence and impotence. The new test uses a urine sample, dispensing with the need for needles. It searches the urine for a protein called EN2, which is not made by healthy people but is pumped out by tumours, and is 70 per cent reliable . Professor Pandha, who created the test with Dr Richard Morgan, added: ‘Our trials have shown that levels of EN2 accurately reflect the amount of cancer in the patient’s prostate gland. ‘Small prostate cancers do not require treatment and can be safely monitored; larger volume cancers require prompt treatment. ‘The EN2 test allows for the\\xa0 urologist to determine which option is best for the patient.’ Tim Sharp, of the Prostate Project, which part-funded the research, said: ‘This is potentially the most exciting development in the diagnosis of prostate cancer for 25 years.’ Prostate Cancer UK said Professor Pandha’s results were encouraging but added that large-scale, long-term trials were needed. Dr Peter FitzGerald, of Randox Laboratories, one of the two companies that will turn the research into a kit for use in doctors’ surgeries, said: ‘With prostate and bladder cancers being among the top ten common causes of cancer death, accurate diagnosis is incredibly important.’ Prostate Cancer UK .',\n",

Police were called after Rachel Hobbs, who goes under the name Lacey Lorenzo for her adult work, said she received a tirade of abuse when she complained that plates used to\\xa0serve her birthday cake were dirty. The 21-year-old, who works for late-night TV channels\\xa0says that the waitress at The Crown in Bromley, south London, had recognised\\xa0her from her work. Glamour model Rachel Hobbs' (pictured) 21st birthday meal ended with police attending the restaurant after a waitress shouted at her 'At least I don't get my t**s out on TV' Miss Hobbs' 76-year-old grandmother, who was at the family celebration, had not known what she did for a living until then. Bosses at the Toby Carvery restaurant dialled 999 after Miss Hobbs lost her temper in response but\\xa0police took no action over the December 8 incident.\\xa0The chain has now apologised for the 'unprofessional\\xa0comments' of its waitress. But Miss Hobbs, of Bromley in south London, says that the row has 'ruined' her birthday. She told how she complained that the paper plates used to hand out her cake\\xa0were dirty. She recalled: 'They gave us dirty plates. They had bits of dried food stuck\\xa0to them. 'When I said 'Excuse me, these plates are dirty', the staff had such bad\\xa0attitude that they just grabbed them back. 'I said 'That is not very good customer service' and the waitress shouted\\xa0out in front of everybody 'At least I don't get my t**s out on TV'. Toby Carvery, in Bromley, south London, has now apologised to Miss Hobbs for the 'unprofessional comments' of its waitress . 'The restaurant manager was right there. She shouted it in front of him and\\xa0he did not know what to say. 'It's so unprofessional to do that for someone, especially when you can see\\xa0it is their 21st birthday because there are balloons saying that on the\\xa0table. 'It's just my job. My nan didn't even know about my job until then but they\\xa0obviously knew who I was in there. 'I just wanted to go there because I really enjoy roast dinners. It was so\\xa0messed up. 'It ruined my birthday. I was crying. I just wanted to have fun on that day. 'For the rest of my life, I am always going to remember being insulted by\\xa0some stupid little idiot on my 21st birthday.' Miss Hobbs (pictyred posing with mother Maria Draa) goes under the name Lacey Lorenzo and says the waitress recognised her from her 'adult work' Miss Hobbs' mum Maria Draa, 55, said: 'The police were called because my\\xa0daughter lost her temper. We were just gobsmacked.' Miss Hobb's grandmother Joan Skipper, 76, said: 'It was a pretty bad\\xa0commotion. 'I am not up with what Rachel does. I was not expecting the police to turn up at her birthday.' A Toby Carvery spokesman said: 'We apologise to Rachel or her family for\\xa0any upset caused and for the unprofessional comments made by a member of\\xa0our team. 'We have investigated the complaint fully and are dealing with the employee\\xa0involved. 'Our manager apologised unreservedly to the family at the time and also\\xa0waived the meal bill as a gesture of goodwill.'
