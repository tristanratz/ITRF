The war was one of the defining events of his political outlook and a significant part of what led him to write in 1946, \"Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it.\"\n",

He was described as a god of generation, dissolution, plenty, wealth, agriculture, periodic renewal and liberation. Saturn's mythological reign was depicted as a Golden Age of plenty and peace. After the Roman conquest of Greece, he was conflated with the Greek Titan Cronus. Saturn's consort was his sister Ops, with whom he fathered Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto, Juno, Ceres and Vesta. Saturn was especially celebrated during the festival of Saturnalia each December, perhaps the most famous of the Roman festivals, a time of feasting, role reversals, free speech, gift-giving and revelry. The Temple of Saturn in the Roman Forum housed the state treasury and archives (aerarium) of the Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire.

The Romans identified Saturn with the Greek Cronus, whose myths were adapted for Latin literature and Roman art. In particular, Cronus's role in the genealogy of the Greek gods was transferred to Saturn. As early as Andronicus (3rd century ), Jupiter was called the son of Saturn. Saturn had two mistresses who represented different aspects of the god. The name of his wife, Ops, the Roman equivalent of Greek Rhea, means \"wealth, abundance, resources.\" The association with Ops is considered a later development, however, as this goddess was originally paired with Consus. Earlier was Saturn's association with Lua (\"destruction, dissolution, loosening\"), a goddess who received the bloodied weapons of enemies destroyed in war. Under Saturn's rule, humans enjoyed the spontaneous bounty of the earth without labour in the \"Golden Age\" described by Hesiod and Ovid. He became known as the god of time.\n",

The film is significant for its time in that Finch's homosexual character is depicted as successful and relatively well-adjusted, and not particularly upset by his sexuality. In this sense, Sunday Bloody Sunday was a considerable departure from Schlesinger's previous film Midnight Cowboy (1969), which portrayed its gay characters as alienated and self-loathing, as well as other gay-themed films of the era, including The Boys in the Band (1970) and Some of My Best Friends Are...

Published in 1938 (about a year before the war ended) with little commercial success, it gained more attention in the 1950s following the success of Orwell\\'s better-known works Animal Farm (1945) and Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). Covering the period between December 1936 and June 1937, Orwell recounts Catalonia\\'s revolutionary fervor during his training in Barcelona, his boredom on the front lines in Aragon, his involvement in the interfactional May Days conflict back in Barcelona on leave, his getting shot in the throat back on the front lines, and his escape to France after the POUM was declared an illegal organization. The war was one of the defining events of his political outlook and a significant part of what led him to write in 1946, \"Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it.\"',\n",

      "[INST]what is a fruit and what is a vegetable[/INST][ANS] A fruit is the mature ovary of a seed plant, usually developed from a flower. A vegetable is a plant or that part of a plant which is edible, and does not necessarily have a role in the plant's reproductive cycle.\n",
      "<s>Background: Yes, it’s true. Many “vegetables” have been parading around as fruits, and we’re here to unveil their secret. But before we unmask the produce perpetrators, let’s talk about what actually makes a fruit a fruit and a vegetable a vegetable.\n",
      "Fruits have seeds and are a product of a flowering plant, like trees, bushes or vines. Hence, banana tree, strawberry bush, and grapevine.\n",
      "Vegetables are generally roots, stems, and leaves. For example, carrots and potatoes are actually roots that are pulled up from underground, and cabbage and spinach are leaves.\n",

      "<s>Background: Fruits and vegetables are plants that we eat. Since we are omnivores, we eat both plants and meat. The meat that we eat are cows, pigs, sheep, chicken, duck and sea food. Fruits and vegetables grow in either trees or the ground. Fruits and vegetables are in the same food group. So above, it says fruits and vegetables are plants that grow. The difference between a fruit and a vegetable is that fruits have seeds and vegetables don't. Bananas may appear to have no seeds but they do. Some people might also think that tomatoes, cucumbers and kiwi are vegetables\n",

      "<s>Background: but they are completely a fruit because of their seeds. Also, vegetables are either the root part or the actual bulk of the plant that we eat, while fruits are the seed parts of the plant that are produced from flowers. When we pick a vegetable, usually the entire plant is taken out, but when we pick fruit, the plant lasts to produce more fruit. This hold true for all the above stated fruits.\n",

      "<s>Background: Fortified soy products are often fortified with both vitamin D and calcium. Fortified Tofu can provide up to 157IU (39% DV) of vitamin D per 100 gram serving, or 44IU (11% DV) per ounce. Fortified Soy Milk can provide up to 49IU (12% DV) of vitamin D per 100 gram serving, 119IU (30% DV) per cup. Amounts of vitamin D vary widely between products, so be sure to check nutrition facts for vitamin D content.\n",

      "<s>Background: Vegans and vegetarians are at a higher risk of vitamin D deficiency because of their limited intake of dairy, meat, and fish. If you have a plant-based diet, make sure to include fortified tofu. Be sure to pay attention to the packaging the next time you go grocery shopping because not all tofu is fortified with vitamin D. One serving of fortified tofu contains 101 UI of vitamin D. Tofu is more versatile than you think. You can bake it, grill it, or add to a delicious stir-fry.\n",

      "[INST]are fortified soy-based food good source of vitamin d[/INST][ANS] Yes\n",
      "<s>Background: Very few foods are naturally rich in Vitamin D. Fortified foods are the major dietary sources of vitamin D, and these include milk, soy milk, cereal grains, margarine, bread and pastries. It is important for individuals with limited sun exposure (from whatever cause or for whatever reason) to include a food source of vitamin D in their diet.\n",
      "In Australia, there is mandatory fortification of table edible oil spreads (eg low-fat spreads) and table margarine, and voluntary fortification of modified and skim milks, powdered milk, yoghurts, table confections and cheese.\n",

      "<s>Background: Essentially what you are looking for are foods that have been fortified with vitamin D by manufacturers because it is not a common natural ingredient in food. The most likely way of taking enough vitamin D is via supplements as it is difficult to recommend exposure to sun as that could increase chances of skin cancer and isn’t always feasible for people with full time jobs.\n",

      "[INST]are fortified soy-based food good source of vitamin d[/INST][ANS] Yes\n",
      "<s>Background: What it does: Vitamin D helps with absorption of calcium to keep your bones healthy, and some studies have linked it to mood and immune function, notes Lopez. Fatty fish like salmon and tuna are among the best sources of D along with fortified milk, yogurt, and eggs; plant-based sources include mushrooms and fortified OJ.\n",
      "Why vegans need it: “Most people have trouble getting enough vitamin D whether they’re vegan or not,” says Lopez. But how much D doctors think the average person needs, however, is changing. “We’re learning and trying to get a better handle on it,” she adds.\n",

      "Mushrooms provide some vitamin D (some mushrooms have the vitamin D content boosted by exposing these mushrooms to ultraviolet light)\n",
      "Almost all of the U.S. milk supply is fortified with 400 IU of vitamin D per quart. But foods made from milk, like cheese and ice cream, are usually not fortified\n",
      "Vitamin D is added to many breakfast cereals and to some brands of orange juice, yogurt, margarine, and soy beverages; check the labels\n",

      "[INST]are fortified soy-based food good source of vitamin d[/INST][ANS] Yes\n",
      "<s>Background: In addition to being an excellent source of calcium, a cup of milk offers between 115 and 124 units of vitamin D. Make sure you check the label of your favourite brand for the exact amount. Fortified plant-based milks, such as soy, also contain vitamin D.
